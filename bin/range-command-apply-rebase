# Keep tag states simple.
# - When nothing tagged, the first tag is always the solo chosen_tag.
#   - The user can pick an action on just the one chosen_tag commit,
#     as opposed to setting another tag to mark a range of commits.
# - When the chosen_tag is set, marking another commit replaces
#   chosen_tag with start_tag and until_tag, marking a commit range.
# - Once both start_tag and until_tag are set, we could disallow the
#   user from moving or changing either range tag. Or we could try our
#   best to oblige; the user can always reset the chosen_tag to begin
#   marking the range again.
#   - So we'll move tags as best we can if user retags the range, but
#     it won't be the best UX (e.g., start_tag can only be moved to
#     an earlier commit; if user wants later start_tag, they'll have
#     to use '[' to start over with chosen_tag).
