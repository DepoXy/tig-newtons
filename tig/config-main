# Only difference should be 'bind main...' vs. 'bind diff', so commands
# don't apply to other views (pager, reflog, refs, stage, stash, status),

# In many case, using 'generic' is fine, if the binding doesn't shadow

# The following commands work on a range on commits.
# - The mechanism works across two commands:
#   - The user first selects a starting commit.
#   - Then the user selects an ending commit and is prompted to
#     choose the action:
#     - Cherry-pick range, but insist commits not in HEAD history
#       (i.e., only works if user runs `tig <some-other-branch>`,
#        use case being user wants to cherry-pick commits from a
#        separate branch (DUNNO: Is there a use case for picking
#        commits from the same branch?));
#     - Move first rev. before or after second rev.; or
#     - Squash or Fixup first rev. into second rev.
#   - Note we could instead create multiple bindings, one for each
#     action, but that's at least 5 commands and we don't have many
#     available keyboard bindings remaining from which to pick.
# - Perhaps one day we'll PR tig to highlight the first commit selected,
#   but for now we'll use a temporary tag to mark the first selection.
#   - There are emoji racing flags, but not the green starting flag.
#     - So what's a good, catchy symbol to use?
#     - Note that tig doesn't show all emoji characters, or at least
#       that's my experience on Linux Mint 19.3 (which is weird,
#       because I see these same symbols fine in gVim and bash).
#     - Looking at the green emojis and flags:
#         git tag -f "🚩🍏🪴🌱🐲🐉🦕🦚💚🫑🥒🥦🔋📗💵💹🧪♎✅✳️-❇️-🈯🟢-🟩🏁🎌🏴🏳-🏳️"
#                     ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^  ^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^
#       The ^^-underscored emoji appear in tig,
#       and any emoji followed by a dash appears only uses a single
#       character width in tig though the emoji is 2 em, so it bleeds.
#     - Though maybe the "red flag" emoji isn't the worst, it does
#       draw the eye better than green, methinks.
# - I originally thought user could '@' once to mark first commit, then
#   '@' again to mark second commit. But if we want to use tig's %(prompt),
#   which tig resolves before running the shell command, we should use a
#   separate final-commit binding, so the user is not %(prompt)ed on the
#   first-commit binding.
#   - Some bindings I considered:
#     - Use '@' for first, and <C-@> (with inherent <C-Space> alias) for final.
#     - Use '(' for first, and ')' for final.
#     - Or use '[' and ']', and save user two Shift presses.
# - Note using `+sh` vs. `>sh`:
#   - The 'main' view updates immediately on `bind main [ >sh ...`,
#     but it doesn't update on `bind main [ +sh ...`. But it's
#     the latter that lets us echo to the status line. Phooey.
#   - I tested each refresh-mode, including periodic, and only
#     `refresh-mode = after-command` with `>sh` causes refresh.
#   - It'd be nice to print a status message, e.g.,
#       echo \"Now select a later commit and press ']'...\";
#     but, oh well, nothing we can't solve in post!:
#     - MAYBE/2023-02-13: Another tig PR idea: Refresh view on '+sh';
#       or maybe it's that 'periodic' or 'auto' only check if commit
#       history changed, but don't monitor tags.

# I'm torn on using %(prompt) or shelling-out and prompting user.
# - The %(prompt) resolves before the shell code runs, so there's a chance
#   user didn't set the beginning tag, and we'll prompt and then fail.
# - On the other hand, if we don't %(prompt), we can fail if not starting
#   tag, but then we'll have to prompt user through the shell, which is
#   not as elegant and using the status line.
# - We'll keep it in-house for now and see how it goes; user's will
#   probably quickly learn to set the starting tag first, and also
#   this way new users will more easily discover what this binding
#   does.
#   - Oh, another benefit to the shell-out prompt is `read -n 1`,
#     saving user a carriage return.
