# BWARE: This used to also include '--src-prefix=a/ --dst-prefix=b/'
# here to support the `v` and `e` commands (GVim opener, and EDITOR
# opener) but the prefix options break the built-in `:edit` command.
# Fortunately the `v` and `e` commands were adjusted to work regardless
# of the prefix options.
# - tl;dr: Don't set prefix options here.
